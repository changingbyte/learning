# Backend Design Patterns Implementation

This repository contains implementations of design patterns specifically tailored for backend development scenarios. Each pattern is organized to provide clear understanding and practical usage in backend systems.

## Structure

Each pattern implementation follows this structure:

1. **Use Cases**
   - Real-world backend scenarios where the pattern is applicable
   - Problems it solves in backend development
   - When to use and when not to use

2. **Examples**
   - Concrete backend examples (e.g., database operations, API handling, etc.)
   - Sample scenarios with expected outputs
   - Integration examples with other backend components

3. **Implementation**
   - Complete Python code implementation
   - Detailed comments explaining each component
   - Best practices and considerations

## Patterns Included

### Behavioral Patterns
1. Chain of Responsibility - Request processing pipeline
2. Command - Job queue processing
3. Interpreter - Query language parsing
4. Iterator - Database result processing
5. Mediator - Service communication
6. Memento - Database transaction rollback
7. Observer - Event handling system
8. State - Order processing workflow
9. Strategy - Dynamic algorithm selection
10. Template Method - Data processing pipeline
11. Visitor - Data structure operations

### Structural Patterns
1. Adapter - Legacy system integration
2. Bridge - Database abstraction
3. Composite - API response structuring
4. Decorator - Request/Response middleware
5. Facade - Service abstraction
6. Flyweight - Cache management
7. Proxy - API Gateway implementation

### Creational Patterns
1. Abstract Factory - Database connection management
2. Builder - Complex object construction
3. Factory Method - Plugin architecture
4. Prototype - Configuration templates
5. Singleton - Shared resource management
